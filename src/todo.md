# Todo

change resolution ++ frame rate

reuse path in the astar
astar any-time invariant
putting pre-computed costs ** 

time the rotation
DEMO - estimate how far it moved / seqs of movements
as we drive, distnace reduce
cam looking at robot, move the robot according to the path/actions

overlay transparent image and draw on it!!
rotation + final dst angle* bugg...... TODO

state, bounds for rotation
astar in snake frame
obstacles?

implement on the snake .. order rotation + cost for motions/actions
simulations ? testing
